Overview
========

The IPyCOMPSs (Interactive Python binding of Component OMPSs (OpenMP + StarSs)) kernel
is a Jupyter kernel designed to be able to smoothly start and stop the PyCOMPSs runtime and
also to work alongside the IPyCOMPSs JupyterLab extension to be able to provide the user
some information about the execution of the running application.
