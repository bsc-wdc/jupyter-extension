Overview
========

The IPyCOMPSs (Interactive Python binding of COMPSs) kernel is a Jupyter kernel designed to be
able to smoothly start and stop the PyCOMPSs runtime and also to work alongside the IPyCOMPSs
JupyterLab extension to be able to provide the user some information about the execution of
the running application.
