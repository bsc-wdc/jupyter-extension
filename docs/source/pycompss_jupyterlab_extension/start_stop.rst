Starting and stopping the runtime
=================================

Starting the runtime
--------------------

When a notebook with the IPyCOMPSs kernel is in focus and the runtime has not been started,
the start button will be enabled.

Clicking the start button will show a pop-up (...).

Stopping the runtime
--------------------

When a notebook with the IPyCOMPSs kernel is in focus and the runtime has been started, the
stop button will be enabled.

Clicking the stop button will try to stop the runtime (the kernel state should change to
busy). If it is successful, the stop button will be disabled and the start button will
be enabled accordingly.
