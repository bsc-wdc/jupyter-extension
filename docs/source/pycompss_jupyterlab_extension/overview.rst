Overview
========

The IPyCOMPSs (Interactive Python binding of Component OMPSs (OpenMP + StarSs)) JupyterLab
extension supplies a new tab in the left sidebar of the JupyterLab UI. It contains buttons
that allow to automatically generate the PyCOMPSs decorators from the parameter values that
the user has input and also open the PyCOMPSs reference. There are also other buttons that
work with the PyCOMPSs Jupyter kernel to start and stop the PyCOMPSs runtime, to open the
PyCOMPSs monitor and to show information about the running application.
