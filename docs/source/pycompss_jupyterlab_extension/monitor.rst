Starting, opening and stopping the PyCOMPSs monitor
===================================================

Managing the monitor
--------------------

If more information than the one shown in the execution info panels is needed, the extension
also provides the option to start, open and stop the PyCOMPSs monitor.

Clicking the 'monitor' button will show a drop-down list with three buttons: 'Start', 'Open'
and 'Stop'. (...).
