Showing the execution info
==========================

Clicking on the 'Open (...) panel', (...) will open a panel with the information of the
running PyCOMPSs application. This will only be available if there is a notebook using
the IPyCOMPSs kernel on focus.

Even if the above conditions are met, it is possible that there is no data to be displayed.
In that scenario, a suitable message will appear in the panel.
