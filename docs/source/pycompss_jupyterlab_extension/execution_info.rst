Showing the execution info
==========================

Clicking on the 'See tasks info', 'See tasks status', 'See current task graph', 'See complete
task graph', 'See resources status' or 'See statistics' will open a panel with the
corresponding information of the running PyCOMPSs application. This will only be available if
there is a notebook using the IPyCOMPSs kernel on focus and the panel is not already open.

Even if the above conditions are met, it is possible that there is no data to be displayed.
In that scenario, a suitable message will appear in the panel.
