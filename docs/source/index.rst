PyCOMPSs Jupyter extensions documentation
#########################################

The PyCOMPSs Jupyter extensions are a group of extensions consisting of a Jupyter kernel and
a JupyterLab extension that are developed to improve the integration that PyCOMPSs has in such
environment. This documentation is divided in 3 sections: one for the installation of the
extensions and another one for each of them. Its index can be found at the end of this page.
